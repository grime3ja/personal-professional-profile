    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Jacob Grimes, I am a Junior Computer Science student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA, where I am also doing a minor in Computer Information Systems. I am from Northern Virginia</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, playing videogames, going to concerts with my girlfriend, watching sports, and hanging out with friends.
       Back home, I used to play acoustic guitar for my church Sunday mornings and for the youth group Wednesday nights, and I hope to do that again when I am home for the summer.
